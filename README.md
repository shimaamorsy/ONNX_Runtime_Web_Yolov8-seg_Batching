# ONNX_Runtime_Web_Yolov8-seg_Batching
This repository demonstrates how to use ONNX Runtime to run Yolov8-seg models in the browser, including support for batched image processing. The example application displays several images and applies the Yolov8-seg model to detect objects and segment them, with results displayed directly on the webpage.
